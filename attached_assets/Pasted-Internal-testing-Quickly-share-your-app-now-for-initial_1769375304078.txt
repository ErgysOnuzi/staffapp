Internal testing

Quickly share your app now for initial quality checks
Before you've finished setting up your app, you can quickly distribute builds to your own device or to a small group of your own trusted users. Builds are normally available to users within seconds of being added in Play Console. This is optional, and you'll still need to run a closed test before publishing to everyone in production.

Closed testing

Identify issues in your app, get feedback and unlock production access
With closed testing, you can share your app with a wide group of users that you control. This allows you to identify issues, get feedback and ensure that everything is ready with your app before you launch. You must run a closed test before you can apply to publish your app to everyone in production. Learn more
